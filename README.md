## âœ¨ Overview
This project ingests public Reddit discussions about **co-op/intern experiences** for **University of Waterloo** students and turns them into a clean, queryable **database**.  
Initial scope (M0): read-only demo with a toy dataset and 2â€“3 API routes.  
Later milestones: robust scraping, de-duplication, pay band normalization, quality scoring, dashboards.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Company directory** with **pay reports** (range, currency, period), **benefits** (health, WFH, relocation, housing), and **flags** (ghosting, rescinded offers, toxicity).
- **Source tracing** back to the **post/comment** (stored as URL + anonymized ID).
- **Search & filter** by term, company, term type (Intern/Co-op), location, sector.
- **Quality signals** (planned): confidence score from upvotes, comment corroboration, and author karma.

**M0 (this week)**  
- MySQL schema + seed  
- Hello-world API (list/filter/lookup)  
- Sample SQL tests + expected output
