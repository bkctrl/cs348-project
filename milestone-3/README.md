## 🧱 Create and Load the Sample Database

Create database and schema:
```bash
mysql -u root -p < milestone-1/create-tables.sql
```

Insert sample data and verify (test dataset from C3):
```bash
mysql -u root -p < milestone-1/test-sample.sql
```

You can confirm correct population by:

```bash
mysql -u root -p coop_salaries -e "SELECT * FROM Employer;"
```

## How to Generate and Load the Production Dataset

To generate the production dataset, we aggregate real-world co-op salary reports from multiple public sources, clean and normalize them, and supplement with synthetic data to support student/faculty queries.

1. **Download source CSVs**:
  - Waterloo Co-op Salaries + Blacklist:  
    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OEDRTAalRsyD1iAO5fkp_8HUJUxbYTavotHhwX0AwBU
  - Kaggle Internship Opportunities:  
    Manually download from [kaggle.com/datasets/everydaycodings/internship-opportunities-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/everydaycodings/internship-opportunities-dataset)
  - levels.fyi Internships (2025–2026):  
    Manually export table from [levels.fyi/internships](https://www.levels.fyi/internships/?track=Software%20Engineer&timeframe=2026%20%2F%202025) to CSV

2. **Run the transformation script**:
```bash
python data_transform.py --input waterloo.csv kaggle.csv levels_fyi.csv
```

3.  **Verify production data**:
```bash
mysql -u root -p coop_salaries < milestone-2/test-production.sql > milestone-2/test-production.out
```
